Utilizing Flask and Python, this learning journal allows you to create, edit, and delete your own entries about anything you may have learned.

You can create 'tags' to attach to entries to organize them by subject or common topics. Created tags will automatically be associated with new/already created entries containing the tag text in it's entry.

Home page displays all entries by title and associated tags. There is also a detailed page for each entry if you select one and also an option to view entries only associated with specific tags.
